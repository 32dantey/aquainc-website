    itemDescription:
      'Tube Diffusers are a variant of Fine Bubble Diffuser designed specifically for high sludge affliction in a tank, they are best suited for heavy duty aeration as they have a 360Â° aerator surface and hence sludge formation is lowered around them due to continuation around it. MBRs, CETPs and ETP/STPs all incorporate Tubular diffusers in their designs.',
